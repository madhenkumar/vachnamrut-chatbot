              This project began with a simple observation: many Gujarati-speaking community members struggle to use AI
              for meaningful religious study. When I saw how difficult it was for loved ones to access trustworthy,
              vernacular answers from the “Vachanamrut,” I realized there was a gap between powerful technology and lived,
              cultural experience.

              Building this for my family — and especially seeing my mother’s joy when she could ask questions naturally
              in Gujarati — made the goal clear: bridge culture with technology without compromising faithfulness to the
              text.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI should be inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy — this project was my attempt to embody those values.
